# Hi there, I'm Gabriel Anyosa! üëã

I'm driven by a curiosity to understand and solve complex problems, often diving deep into the 'why' and 'how' behind technologies and systems. Rather than focusing just on the surface application, I enjoy exploring the underlying nuances, whether it's:

* üß† The intricacies of **AI/ML models**, from on-device optimization (like Whisper) to analyzing large-scale behavioral patterns.
* ‚öôÔ∏è Tackling **performance at scale**. I believe optimizing hardware usage (like with **GPU acceleration via CUDA/Metal**) and memory management is fundamental, necessary for large datasets, and an interesting challenge in and of itself.
* üìä Understanding **database internals** and query execution, partly fueled by an interest in how systems interact with **OS-level resources** for peak efficiency.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Designing and building end-to-end data engineering pipelines** (ETL/ELT), for complex or heterogeneous data sources, creating **robust, high-quality datasets** that enable efficient downstream analysis, often involving **comparative benchmarking** (e.g., MongoDB vs. DuckDB) to select the right tools.
* üìà Modeling complex systems, like **developer ecosystems** or forecasting **technology adoption**, often employing quantitative methods.
* üì± Navigating the challenges of **cross-platform development**, especially when integrating native functionalities like iOS audio.

My approach often involves bridging rigorous technical analysis with strategic thinking. Beyond these specific tech areas, I have strong interests in **algorithms, computer science, statistics, quantitative analysis (quant), economics, marketing strategy, and even history**. I truly enjoy translating complex data into actionable insights.
